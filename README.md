# credit-card-fraud-dection

Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. 
Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy. 


In this project I will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.
These models are: 
```
* Decision Tree 
* Support Vector Machine
```
I will use a real dataset to train each of these models. The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by 
European cardholders. You will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.

This project will use:
```
* pandas for managing the data.
* numpy for mathematical operations.
* sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
* seaborn for visualizing the data.
* matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
* more...
```

The dataset is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle:
